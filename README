Publish: A Bibliographic Reference System
-----------------------------------------


Overview
--------

Publish may be used for handling publication lists for research
institutions and departments, or for individual researchers. Publish
imports publication metadata (title, author, year of publication etc),
validates the imported data against a database of known venues, checks
for missing attributes, corrects common errors etc, and allows simple
filtering and generation of publication lists.
