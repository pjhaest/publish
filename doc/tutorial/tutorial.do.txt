======= Motivation =======

Publish is a software for managing your own list of publications or any
list of references to literature. There are numerous tools available for
this purpose, with BibTeX as the most well-known to scientists.
Publish offers several important advantages over BibTeX:

 o the format is simpler (plain self-explanatory text),
 o multiple registrations of the same publication are detected and
   merged to one master registration,
 o flexibly selected parts of the list of publications can be output
   in different formats: BibTeX, HTML, reStructuredText, PDF, ...,
 o the list of publications can easily be manipulated in simple
   Python code to meet various demands for publishing or maintaining
   the list (e.g., exporting the list to other types of software).

Point 2 and 3 are particularly important: publication lists needs to
be formatted also for the web nowadays, and many published lists
suffer from double entries in BibTeX because of slightly different
input by different people.

There should be no need to emphasize the importance of having
beautifully formatted and absolutely correct publication data in your
CV and in your papers. My claim is that unless you really like
to constantly check and polish your BibTeX files, your life gets
much simpler if you use Publish for all publication records and generate
BibTeX or other formats from the Publish format.

======= Publish in action =======

The following sections takes you through the main steps of creating
your first Publish database:

 o import data from another source, here BibTeX files,
 o clean up data,
 o export to other formats,
 o customize the behavior of Publish.

===== Installation =====

Publish is pure Python code hosted at Bitbucket. The following
statements fetch the source code and installs it:

!bc sys
Terminal> hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/logg/publish
Terminal> cd publish
Terminal> sudo python setup.py install
!ec
The first command needs the "Mercurial version control system": "http://mercurial.selenic.com/" (`hg`), which is as easy to install as Publish itself.

===== Importing a BibTeX file =====

Suppose you have some BibTeX files and want to put these in a
Publish database. Technically, this means merging the BibTeX files
to one text file with a simple format. You may choose to have one
Publish database or many.

Here are parts of a sample BibTeX file called `refs1.bib`:

!bc cod
@InProceedings{Mardal_et_al_2003a,
author =    {K.-A. Mardal and G. W. Zumbusch and H. P. Langtangen},
editor =    {H. P. Langtangen and A. Tveito},
title =     {Software Tools for Multigrid Methods},
booktitle = {Advanced Topics in Computational Partial Differential
            Equations -- Numerical Methods and Diffpack Programming},
publisher = {Springer},
series    = {Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering},
year =      {2003},
pages =     {97-152},
}

@Article{Mortensen_et_al_2011,
author         = {M. Mortensen and H. P. Langtangen and G. N. Wells},
title          = {A FEniCS-Based Programming Framework for Modeling
Turbulent Flow by the {Reynolds}-Averaged {Navier-Stokes} Equations},
journal        = {Advances in Water Resources},
year           = {2011},
volume         = {34},
number         = {9},
doi            = {10.1016/j.advwatres.2011.02.013},
}

@Book{Langtangen_2012,
author =    {H. P. Langtangen},
title =     {Python Scripting for Computational Science},
series =    {Texts in Computational Science and Engineering},
publisher = {Springer},
year =      {2012},
edition =   {Third},
}
!ec


Importing this to Publish is done by

!bc sys
Terminal> publish import refs1.bib
!ec
Publish creates a database with the default name `papers.pub`.
The entries from the BibTeX file above are represented as
follows in the database (with long lines cut off):

!bc cod

!ec
The format, referred to as the *pub* format,
should be self-explanatory. The following is worth noticing.

 * Multiple-line values in the BibTeX files are (and must be) single
   line in the pub format.
 * Keys in the BibTeX format become the attribute `key` in the pub format.
 * Most other attributes in the BibTeX format have the same names in
   the pub format.
 * Capitalization, as in `{Navier-Stokes}, is also preserved in
   the pub format.
 * Capitalization forgotten in the BibTeX file, here in the word
   `Python`, is fixed in the pub format (`{P}ython`).
 * Special LaTeX formatting, such as `\emph{...}`, is also valid in
   the pub format.

Publish treated the `refs1.bib` file without any remarks. That is
the exception from the rule: usually Publish will complain about
incomplete or inconsistent information in the BibTeX file,
as the next two sections illustrate.

===== Adding information =====

Imagine we also have another BibTeX file, `refs2.bib`, that we would
like to add to the Publish database `papers.pub`. We just
run `publish import refs2.bib` to accomplish this task. However,
the `refs2.bib` contains a reference

@@@CODE src/refs2.bib fromto: Article\{Haga_et_al@Article\{Rahman_et_al
Publish has not registered the journal in this reference. It therefore
prompts the user and suggests that maybe a journal with a similar
name, in this case *International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering*,
is what was meant.

!bc
Validating paper: (Haga_et_al_2011a) - On the causes of pressure
oscillations in low-permeabl...
  Status is not defined, assuming status is "published".

  Unknown journal: "International Journal of Analytical and
  Numerical Methods in Geomechanics"
  Suggested journal: "International Journal for Numerical
  Methods in Engineering"

  Unknown journal, what should I do?
  [1] Replace journal.
  [2] Add journal.
  [3] Skip paper.
Please enter 1, 2 or 3 (or press return to choose [1]):
!ec
We need to add the journal and hence choose `[2]`.
Added journals, conference proceedings, and other venues are
placed in a database file with default name `venues.list` in the
current working directory. The next time we import some entry
with this journal name, the name will be known to Publish.

The next entry in the `refs2.bib` reads

@@@CODE src/refs2.bib fromto: Article\{Rahman_et_al_2006@Book\{Langtangen_2011
Publish finds the journal name of this entry incomplete and therefore says

!bc
Validating paper: (Rahman_et_al_2006b) - Numerical Investigation
  of a Piezoelectric Surface A...
  Status is not defined, assuming status is "published".

  Unknown journal: "Physical Review B"
  Suggested journal: "Physical Review B: Condensed Matter
  and Materials Physics"
  Unknown journal, what should I do?
  [1] Replace journal.
  [2] Add journal.
  [3] Skip paper.
Please enter 1, 2 or 3 (or press return to choose [1]):
!ec
The right answer here is the complete name of the journal: `[1]`.


===== Merging publication records =====

When publish continues with the `refs2.bib` file it hits the entry

@@@CODE src/refs2.bib fromto: Book\{Langtangen_2011@Article\{Langtangen_et_al_2002
This is the same book as in `refs1.bib`, just a previous edition.
Publish detects that the entries are very similar and prompts
the user about what to do:

 * Keep both references?
 * Ingore both?
 * Keep the first reference and ignore the second? Or the other way around?
 * Merge the two reference into one by choosing a conflicting attribute
   from the first reference or the second?

In this particular case, we are notified about the `edition`
attribute, should it be `Third` or `Second`? Let us say that we just
want the newest one, but decide to examine every attribute, so we
choose `Third` as the correct edition (alternative 5). Then we are
asked about the key, do we want `Langtangen_2012` or `Langtangen_2011`
as the key in the merged item? The consistent choice is
`Langtangen_2012` (alternative 5). Also the year attribute differs,
and we have to choose `2012`. The questions are asked again.  [hpl:
why asking twice?  check it out...]  The resulting item in the Publish
database reads

!bc
* books
** {P}ython Scripting for Computational Science
   key:       Langtangen_2012
   author:    H. P. Langtangen
   year:      2012
   publisher: Springer
   status:    published
   series:    Texts in Computational Science and Engineering
   edition:   Third
   entrytype: book
!ec

__Invalid references.__
Occasionally, Publish is not able to import references correctly.
Such data are collected in a file with name `invalid_papers_DT.pub`,
where `DT` represent current date and time. To get such data into
the database, open the file, make the necessary edits, and try to import
the file.

===== Exporting references =====
label{publish:export}

<%
bitbucket = ''
tutsrc = 'doc/tutorial/src'
%>

We can export all entries in the database
to "BibTex": "${bitbucket}/${tutsrc}/refs.bib",
"PDF (via LaTeX)": "${bitbucket}/${tutsrc}/refs.pdf",
"HTML": "${bitbucket}/${tutsrc}/refs.pdf",
and reStructuredText:

!bc sys
Terminal> publish export refs.bib   # BibTeX
Terminal> publish export refs.html  # HTML
Terminal> publish export refs.rst   # reStructuredText
!ec

===== Command-line arguments =====

The `import` and `export` commands can restrict the attention to
a certain author, year, or category of references, e.g.,

!bc sys
Terminal> publish import category=articles myrefs.bib
Terminal> publish import author=Mardal all.bib
Terminal> publish export category=books refs.pdf
!ec


===== Capitalization =====
label{publish:capitalization}

Sometimes words in titles need to be capitalized. One example is
*Navier-Stokes* where N and S have to be uppercase and the rest
lowercase. For some output formats such as HTML and
reStructuredText the word Navier-Stokes will appear correctly if it
is correctly capitalized in the Publish database. For output to
PDF via LaTeX, one relies on BibTeX, and different BibTeX styles
may treat capitalization of titles differently. The common style called `plain`
will typically typeset titles in lower case. Writing just Navier-Stokes
in the title then results in navier-stokes. This is a well-known
issue for BibTeX users. Publish adopts the same capitalization
technique as BibTeX: the capitalization of
words or characters appearing inside curly
braces is preserved. It means that if we write `{Navier-Stokes}`
in the title, or `{N}avier-{S}tokes`, we are guaranteed that
the output to LaTeX and PDF will be Navier-Stokes and not navier-stokes.

As with BibTeX, Publish users must carefully read titles in the database
and ensure that curly braces are used whenever capitalization requires it.
There is a way out of this described in the next section.

===== Configuration =====
label{publish:config}

The behavior of Publish can be configured through a *configuration file*
called `publish_config.py`. Suppose we want to change the database
name from `papers.pub` to a hidden file with a more descriptive
name: `.publish_references.pub`. Similarly, we want to rename the
`venues.list` file to `.publish_venues.txt`. To this end, we make
a file `publish_config.py` with the content:

!bc pycod
from publish.config.defaults import *

database_filename = '.publish_references.pub'
local_venues_filename = '.publish_venues.txt'
!ec
The `defaults.py` file in the directory `publish/config` of the
Publish source code tree contains all variables that can be
configured by the user in a local `python_config.py` file.
These variables include measures of the distance between strings,
used to decide if two titles or other reference attributes are
sufficiently close to prompt the user for information.

The dictionary `uppercase` in `defaults.py` ensures that its
listed words are properly capitalized when Publish data is exported.
Looking closely at the Publish database, we realize that one entry
has a title starting with "A FEniCS-based Programming ...".
The word FEniCS should be capitalized properly, but the title
lacks curly braces (because the BibTeX file from which the entry
was imported also lacks proper braces). Instead of inserting braces
in the problematic word `FEniCS-based`, we can add
this word to the `uppercase` dictionary.
A key in this directory is the lowercase version of a word,
while the value is the correct capitalization specified via curly
braces. In our case we extend this dictionary with one item,

!bc pycod
uppercase.update({
    "fenics-based": "{FEniCS}-based",
    })
!ec
Publish will then always ensure that any version of the word
FEniCS-based will appear with capital FE and CS in various output formats.
A lot of words are already registered in `uppercase`, such as
FEM, FDM, Python, Cython, FORTRAN, MATLAB, and FEniCS. If you prefer
`Fortran` over the official `FORTRAN`, you can either write
`{F}ortran` yourself in the database, or adjust the `uppercase` dictionary
in the configuration file:

!bc pycod
uppercase.update({
    "fortran": "{F}ortran",
    })
!ec

Publish reads your configuration file by `import python_config`.
This means that you can just place your `python_config.py` file in
the directory where you have the Publish database and where you
run Publish from.
(Larger projects dealing with publication management may want to operate
with different configuration files. Steering which file to use is
then done via the rules for import in Python. Normally, one sets
the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable appropriately to control
the import of the desired configuration file.)

======= Programming Publish =======

 * New output not in categories.
 * New output formatting.
