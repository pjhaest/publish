* Add documentation for new features:
  - Key generation
  - PDF file storage
  - HTML output
  - Key "private"
  - print command
  - author file

* Improve handling of duplicated keys. 
As of now if one imports a database and a particular key is present in both, one should not be allowed to keep both publications.
